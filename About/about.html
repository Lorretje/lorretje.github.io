    <!-- Storytelling Elements -->
    Example text: <br>
    I started my journey in web development during college when I built my first website for a school project—a simple blog using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.<br>Since then, I've grown passionate about creating user-friendly interfaces and solving real-world problems through technology.<br><br>

    One funny anecdote is when I accidentally deleted an entire project's codebase while trying to refactor it!<br>It was frustrating but taught me the importance of version control systems like Git.<br><br>

    Professionally, some highlights include working on [Project Name], which involved building a responsive e-commerce site using React.js for [Client Name].<br>This experience not only honed my frontend skills but also showed me how impactful well-designed digital solutions can be for businesses.<br><br>

    My "why" is rooted in making technology accessible to everyone through intuitive design principles and innovative solutions that solve everyday challenges.<br><br>

    Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking and exploring new outdoor spots—a hobby that keeps me grounded amidst all the screen time!
